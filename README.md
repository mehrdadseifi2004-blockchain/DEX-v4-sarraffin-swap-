## Overview
**Sarraff.in** is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) that allows users to swap tokens directly from their wallets without intermediaries.  
It operates using the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model, similar to Uniswap or PancakeSwap, enabling fast, non-custodial token swaps and liquidity provision.

## Key Features

- Add/Remove liquidity to pools
- Earn trading fees by providing liquidity
- Fully non-custodial – you always control your private keys
- Clean and fast user interface
- Supports multiple EVM-compatible networks (primarily BNB Smart Chain and others based on available pairs)
- No KYC or registration required

## How to Use
1. Visit [https://sarraff.in](https://sarraff.in)
2. Click **Connect Wallet** (supports MetaMask, Trust Wallet, WalletConnect, etc.)
3. Go to the **Swap** tab, select the tokens and amount
4. Review the route and estimated output
5. Confirm the transaction in your wallet
6. Wait for on-chain confirmation

### Providing Liquidity
1. Navigate to the **Pool** or **Liquidity** section
2. Select a trading pair
3. Deposit equal values of both tokens
4. Receive LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens and start earning fees
